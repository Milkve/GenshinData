(test)...The stone peaks in Liyue have attracted the attention of many knights, but I'm not a fan of them. Stone is rough, and scratches the hands. Instead, I like a kind of flower known as the Silk Flower. It has a fine texture and gives off a faint aroma. If I weren't so far away, I would bring some back for you. I bet you would love them.
